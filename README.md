Hello!

Task for making street from simple line is split by several steps:
1. Get lines from shp.
2. Intersection all lines and get intersect.
3. At the intersections, measure the angles between all the lines and choose the most correct one.
4. Get only dublicates lines whatever happened twice.
5. Union coordinates to line.
6. Show lines by matplotlib.
